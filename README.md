# Hey there, we are Rustic Root Design

Welcome! I raft websites that feel calm, clear, and quietly beautiful - thoughtful spaces where design and function meet. Inspired by timeless simplicity and grounded creativity, I'm currently building my portfolio and learning every step of the way.

## What I'm Working on:
-  A minimal, custom portfolio site to showcase my design work
-  Exploring clean layouts, accessible design, and strong visual identity
-  Connecting with small business owners and creatives who need a digital home

Thanks for stopping by - stick around, more is coming soon!
